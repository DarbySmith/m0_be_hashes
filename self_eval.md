# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
    * I struggled the most with the first `hashes_1.rb` file. I was getting a hang of it still and I felt more confident when I moved onto hashes_2.rb.
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
    * I feel like I am taking good notes. I think I have been more efficent with my notetaking since Monday. I take the most helpful notes when I have examples and I can write the content in my own words.
- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
    * I try to solve the problem on my own first. I try to look back carefully at the error message, my code and notes to see if I made any silly mistakes. It is usually forgetting a space, comma, or other small problem. For conceptual problems I try to solve them myself, but I do end up Googling a lot.
